# Design System

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guidelines, and best practices that help teams build consistent, scalable, and efficient digital products. 

A design system includes both visual and code-based elements that ensure a unified user experience across different platforms and applications:

## Design System Concepts

* **Style guide** – colours, typography, spacing and layout, icons, imagery, and branding. 

* **Component library** – individual components (building blocks) such as buttons, forms, input fields, navigation bars, tooltips, etc.

* **Pattern library** – groups of components that work together to deliver a piece of functionality, for example, a navigation bar with a logo, links, search form, and action button.

* **Interaction guidelines** - button hover and click effects, transitions and animations, loading spinners, progress bars, and error, success, warning messages.

* **Internationalization and localization** - multiple languages and multiple locations, such as for showing words, numbers, dates, currencies.

* **Accessibility and usability standards** - colour contrast for readability, keyboard navigation support, and assistive technologies compatibility.

* **Code standards and documentation** - code components, when and how to use them, etc.

## Benefits

A design system is essential for digital products and services because it ensures consistency, efficiency, and scalability across systems:

* Consistency – it provides a unified language, ensuring that elements like buttons, typography, and colour schemes remain consistent across all platforms and channels.

* Faster, more cost effective, development and design – modular components can be reused from an existing library of elements which saves teams having to reinvent components for every new feature or product. Less time is spent on repetitive design and development tasks. This results in faster delivery of new products and features to users.

* Improved collaboration and efficiency - designers, developers, and product owners speak a common language which reduces miscommunication and streamlines workflows.

* Better user experience - consistent design patterns make interfaces more predictable and intuitive for users, ensuring that users don’t have to relearn behaviours across different systems and products.

* Accessibility - accessibility guidelines, ensure that products are inclusive and usable for all.

* Maintenance and scalability – a design system provides a single source of truth. Changes to design elements can be made globally rather than modified in multiple places. As products and services evolve, the design system scales with them, making it easier to add new features to existing systems. 

* Quality – a design system would provide a foundation for measuring the quality of our product and services and serve as a reference point for managing and maturing UCD within our governance frameworks, for example, by adopting GDS style service assessments.

## Risks

The lack of a design system can lead to inconsistent user experiences, design and technical debt, challenges with maintaining and scaling products and services, gaps in communication between designers and developers, duplicated effort and cost in design and development work, and delays in getting new products, services and features into the hands of users.
