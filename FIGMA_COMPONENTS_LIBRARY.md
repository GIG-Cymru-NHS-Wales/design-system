## STYLES

<strong>Description</strong>

Make your service look like other NHS services with these tested styles.

If you are using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit or have GOV.UK Frontend included in your build, the coded examples in the Design System will not need any additional styling.

If you are using the NHS.UK prototype kit or have the NHS.UK frontend library included in your build, the coded examples in the service manual do not need any additional styling.

If you need to apply styles manually, you should still follow existing GOV.UK and NHS.UK conventions. For example, do not assign new meanings to colours, do not change the style of buttons or adjust the thickness of borders on form inputs.

## COMPONENTS

<strong>Description</strong>

Components are reusable parts of a user interface. Using pre-built, core elements allows government teams to build consistent services.

You can also use the individual components in different patterns and contexts. For example, you can use the Text input component to ask for an email address, a National Insurance number or someone’s name.

If you’re using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, or have included GOV.UK Frontend in your build, coded examples will render the same as in the Design System.

If you are using the NHS.UK prototype kit or have the NHS.UK frontend library included in your build, the coded examples for each component will render exactly as they do in the service manual.

The GOV.UK and NHS.UK Design System’s code is public and freely available under a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license. You can find the Gov.UK code repositories on GitHub, where we code in the open.
